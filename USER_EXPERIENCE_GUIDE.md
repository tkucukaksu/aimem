# AIMem User Experience Guide

## 🎯 Design Principles

### 1. **Invisible Intelligence**
AIMem should work intelligently in the background without requiring constant user configuration. The system should make smart decisions automatically while keeping users informed of important actions.

### 2. **Progressive Disclosure**
Show essential information first, with detailed information available on request. Users shouldn't be overwhelmed with technical details unless they need them.

### 3. **Predictable Behavior**
Similar actions should produce similar results. The system should behave consistently across different contexts and sessions.

### 4. **Graceful Recovery**
When things go wrong, provide clear explanations and actionable recovery steps. Always suggest alternatives when possible.

## 🚀 Key User Experience Features

### **Smart Session Management**
- Automatic project detection from working directory
- Intelligent session ID generation based on project context
- Seamless legacy session migration
- Session hierarchy for feature branches

### **Context-Aware Memory**
- Automatic context storage during conversations
- Intelligent relevance ranking for context retrieval
- Smart memory cleanup based on usage patterns
- Task-aware context expansion

### **Performance Transparency**
- Real-time performance metrics
- Memory usage monitoring
- Bottleneck identification
- System health indicators

## 📝 Response Guidelines

### **Success Messages**
```
✅ Successfully stored 15 code chunks from your project
🔗 Found and connected to existing session: my-project-main
📊 Session optimized: Freed 2.3MB, kept 47 high-importance chunks
```

### **Progress Indicators**
```
🔍 Analyzing project structure...
💾 Storing context chunks (8/15 completed)...
🧹 Cleaning up old context (removing 12 outdated chunks)...
```

### **Error Messages**
```
❌ Session not found: 'old-session-id'
💡 Tip: Try using your project directory path instead
🔄 Auto-migrating from legacy session...
```

### **Informational Messages**
```
ℹ️  This is your first time in this project
💡 AIMem detected a Node.js project with React framework
📈 Performance: 2.4k requests/sec, 15ms avg latency
```

## 🛠️ Tool Behavior Standards

### **Auto-Execution Tools**
These tools should execute automatically without confirmation:
- `get_or_create_project_session` - Always safe
- `auto_store_project` - Safe, enhances experience
- `context_aware_retrieve` - Read-only, always safe
- `store_context` - Safe, essential for functionality

### **Confirmation Required Tools**
These tools should ask before execution:
- `cleanup_session` - Destructive operation
- `create_feature_session` - Creates new resources

### **Silent Mode**
Many tools support a `silent` parameter:
- `true` (default): Minimal output, focus on results
- `false`: Verbose output with detailed progress

## 🎨 Response Formatting

### **Structured Information**
Use consistent formatting for similar data:

```
📁 Project: my-awesome-app
🏷️  Type: Node.js + React
📍 Location: /Users/dev/projects/my-awesome-app
🆔 Session: a1b2c3d4-main

📊 Memory Status:
• Total chunks: 42
• Memory usage: 8.2MB / 100MB
• Last cleanup: 2 hours ago
```

### **Lists and Tables**
Use clear, scannable formats:

```
📋 Related Sessions:
  1. my-awesome-app-main (active) - 2.3MB
  2. my-awesome-app-feature-auth (archived) - 1.1MB
  3. my-awesome-app-debug-api (active) - 0.8MB
```

### **Code and Technical Details**
Present code clearly with proper formatting:

```typescript
// Stored context from: src/components/UserAuth.tsx
interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  role: 'admin' | 'user';
}
```

## 🔧 Error Handling Patterns

### **Common Error Scenarios**

1. **Session Not Found**
   - Show clear error message
   - Suggest alternatives (project path, legacy migration)
   - Offer to create new session

2. **Memory Limits Exceeded**
   - Show current usage vs. limits
   - Suggest cleanup strategies
   - Offer automatic optimization

3. **Project Detection Failed**
   - Explain what was attempted
   - Show detected files/patterns
   - Suggest manual configuration

4. **Performance Issues**
   - Show current metrics
   - Identify bottlenecks
   - Suggest optimizations

## 📈 Performance Communication

### **Metrics Presentation**
Present performance data in user-friendly terms:

```
⚡ Performance Snapshot:
• Response time: Excellent (12ms avg)
• Memory usage: Healthy (45% of limit)
• Request rate: 1,247 req/sec
• Error rate: 0.02% (very low)

🎯 Optimization Opportunities:
• Consider cleanup of 23 old chunks (save ~2MB)
• Session cache hit rate could improve (67% -> 85%)
```

## 🎓 User Education

### **Onboarding Tips**
For new users, provide helpful guidance:

```
💡 Quick Start Tips:
1. AIMem automatically detects your project type
2. Context is stored automatically during conversations
3. Use natural language to search your context
4. Sessions are project-based for better organization
```

### **Advanced Features**
Gradually introduce advanced capabilities:

```
🚀 Pro Tips:
• Create feature sessions for specific work streams
• Use focus areas to customize project analysis
• Enable performance monitoring for optimization insights
• Set memory strategies based on your workflow
```

## 🔄 Workflow Integration

### **Common Workflows**

1. **Starting New Project Work**
   ```
